I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Form Finding Lab, at Princeton University. I develop lightweight structural systems through the study of computational morphology and origami engineering with Prof. Sigrid Adriaenssens. My research is currently funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation through the [Institute for Data Driven Dynamical Design](https://www.mines.edu/id4/).

I hold a Master of Science in Structural Engineering from the University of São Paulo, Brazil (2016-2019). There, I developed a custom [connection system for rigid gridshell structures](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102996) with advice from Prof. Ruy Pauletti and in collaboration with Prof. Leila Meneghetti. 
I also obtained a B.Sc. In Civil Engineering from Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) (2010-2015), and spent an academic year abroad at Cornell University (2013). 

I worked at Arup Brazil, first as a project management intern (2014-2015) in projects such as the [Rio Metro Line 4 South review](https://www.arup.com/projects/rio-metro-line-4-south), and then as a structural engineer (2015-2016), designing prestressed concrete beams in a [residential building by Zaha Hadid Architects](https://www.arup.com/projects/casa-atlantica). Before that, I interned at [Todd Zwigard Architects](https://tzaia.com/dorf1.html) in the summer of 2013.
